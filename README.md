# Interative-card
This practical is based on creating a page that replicates the area where users enter their data to generate a payment depending on the purchase or payment they are making.

Tools:

The support tools provided by FRONEND MENTOR were used.

Some CSS Grid was used.

JavaScript was used to generate a fluid interaction between the user and the page.

Dynamic errors are generated in case the user wants to test the functionality of the page.

Steps:

1.- First, the HTML text was generated as mentioned in the guide.

2.- Comments were placed for a better reading of the code.

3.- In the CSS styles, first we used a bit of CSS Grid and we also used the style guide that FRONTEND MENTOR provides us.

4.- With Js, first import the Cleave.Js library, however, as it did not follow the standards of practice, it was left aside.

5.- The functions were used:
  
	5.1 ShowError in order to border the blank boxes or with incorrectly entered data.
  
	5.2 VerfyIsFilled in order to verify that the form is not empty.
  
	5.3 ValidateLetters in order to display an error on the screen when entering letters in fields where only numbers are required.

6.- Other errors were added that complement ShowError in each box of the form in case the user did not enter the data correctly.
